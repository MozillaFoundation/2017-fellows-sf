      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Working together, we learn basics of open practice and apply them to our actual projects, doing real and useful work to move our projects forward 
      </p>
      <h3>Open Mentorship + Workshop</h3>
      <p>We structured the WOW as a kickoff to a mentorship program for projects, called the Open Leadership Training Series (OLTS), and created a system of mentorship cohorts for leaders in "open work" globally.</p>
      <ul>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mentorship-program">Mentorship Program</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The kickoff event was called WOW Berlin - Feb 2016, and attempted to onboard all projects to the principles of open practice before their remote mentorship meetings in the months that followed: check out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q9A0IooHeoA3z4tLUm0ytfPukw5tgbjM-xyTYr9MpGU/edit?usp=sharing">Presentation</a></p>

      <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Exercise I</h1>
          <h3>Why run a wow in your community?</h3>
          <time>5 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Think about who to invite, criteria, outcomes:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>> people who were eager to engage but we hadn't yet found a place for them</li>
              <li>> people who are well-connected and have potential far-reaching impact</li>
              <li>> people who are leading work in some way; we saw where they could apply the skills (they have a project)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Exercise II</h1>
          <h3>Who in your communities would most benefit from these skills?</h3>
          <time>5 minutes</time>
          <p>
            Select/create the curriculum:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>> poll invitees to find out what they need</li>
              <li>> poll invitees to find out what they have to offer</li>
              <li>> short presentations, and then work together sessions on real stuff, ie. setting up github, writing documentation, making plans</li>
              <li>> look at the materials that are here-- what would you add/subtract? what might participants contribute?</li>
              <li>> do you have any questions about what the materials are, why they were included</li>
              <li>> setting up the schedule for networking, relaxing, etc </li>
              <li>community events</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Exercise III</h1>
          <h3>Curriculum outline, build a schedule with paper prototypes.</h3>
          <time>20 minutes</time>
          <p>Think about logistics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>> Walkthrough <a href="https://mzl.la/2017wow">website</a></li>
            <li>> Go over <a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/sciencelab-work-2017-WOW">WOW Montreal</a> - March 2017</li>
            <li>> Think about where will your WOWs be? (dates, location)</li>
            <li>> Think about your budget?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>For <strong>homework</strong>, consider the logistics you planned, review your timeline, scheduling, contact people who will make your WOW awesome.</p>
