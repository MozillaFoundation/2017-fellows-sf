      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction and Motivation</h2>

      <h3>Chicago is now one of the most heavily surveilled cities in the world</h3>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://redshiftzero.github.io/policesurveillance/">Extensive video surveillance</a> network "Operation Virtual Shield": 26,000+ cameras</li>
          <li>Extremely poor controls on the use of these cameras, from a <a href=" http://chicagoinspectorgeneral.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Audit-of-OEMC-Public-Safety-Cameras.pdf
">recent audit</a>: "OEMC [Office of Emergency Management] could not, in most instances, determine which individuals accessed the camera system or how those individuals used the cameras"
          <li>Lots of other surveillance toys in use: Shotspotter, Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPR), Stingray cell site simulators</li>
          <li>Most recently: <a href="http://www.citylab.com/crime/2016/12/how-police-are-watching-on-social-media/508991/">social media surveillance</a>, body cameras</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Social media surveillance training documents</h3>

      <h3>Monitored groups</h3>
      <img src="../assets/images/transparency/osig.png" />

      </p>

            <h3>There is a long history of police misconduct in Chicago</h3>
            <p>

              <ul>
                <li>US Department of Justice just issued a report of their civil rights investigation of Chicago Police, finding racially biased policing, widespread misconduct, and little accountability.</li>
                <li>History of torture: Jon Burge was a police commander that ran a <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jon-burge-ex-chicago-cop-who-ran-torture-ring-released-prison">torture ring</a> to extract false confessions; more recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/19/homan-square-chicago-police-disappeared-thousands">Homan Square</a> was reported by the Guardian as a "black site" where police "disappeared" 7,000 people</li>
                <li>Police <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/report-chicago-cops-ignored-recommendation-to-fire-officers-after-laquan-mcdonald-shooting-b3b04ae7a39#.9atqow77t
      ">covered up the murder</a> of Laquan McDonald</li>
                <li>Chicago Police seize millions of dollars from Chicago residents not necessarily convicted of a crime and use this money to buy surveillance devices and fund the war on drugs. Read more: <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/police-department-civil-forfeiture-investigation/Content?oid=23728922">Inside the Chicago Police Department's Secret Budget</a></li>
                <li>Police abide by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK_OA1RH204">"Code of Silence"</a> preventing the reporting of problems by officers who may observe misconduct. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8-YcKC_mhI">Watch full episode of Fault Lines here.</a></li>
              </ul>
            </p>

      <h3>The police complaints process is one method that residents subject to police misconduct can use to hold the police accountable.</h3>

      <p>An oversight body or internal affairs (depending on the complaint) are supposed to investigate and hold officers accountable for their actions.</p>
      <p>In practice, thousands of complaints are almost immediately thrown away. From March 2011 - March 2015 at least 28% of complaints (4,000+ complaints) were trashed.</p>
      <p>This was due to the investigators not knowing the name or badge number associated with an officer.</p>

      <h2>"I didn't get their name or badge number. But if I ever saw their face again, I would recognize them"</h2>

      <h2>Enter OpenOversight</h2>

      <p>Initial launch in October (mostly to let people know we are doing it and to send their photos to us): <a href="https://openoversight.lucyparsonslabs.com">https://openoversight.lucyparsonslabs.com</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable potential complainants to find the officers that they want to complain on</li>
        <li>Users put in the information they know about the officer and see a gallery of potential matches</li>
        <li>If they find the offending officer and recognize them, they can file a complaint using the provided name and badge number</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data Sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Officer-level demographic information: Name, gender, race, age (public records requests)</li>
        <li>Officer-level duty details: Rank, assignment, badge number, date they joined the force (public records requests)</li>
        <li>Officer images: acquired through social media scraping and through soliciting photographs from the public</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Critical support from the activist community in Chicago: we have had a lot of support from groups like <a href="PPL's Response Team">People's Response Team</a> who do trainings on how to minimize risk while filming law enforcement. We had a community meeting with activist groups to get feedback on what they wanted to see in OpenOversight. </p>

      <h3>Privacy vs Transparency</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>"You have no expectation of privacy in a public space."</li>
      <li>All photographs are of police officers in uniform in a public space.</li>
      <li>All information on OpenOversight only relates to the officer's duties as a public officer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Response</h2>

      <p>Press response <a href="http://www.citylab.com/crime/2016/10/crowdsourcing-police-accountability/504650/">Chicago activists turn the tables on police surveillance</a>, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-313-montreal-worship-ban-protecting-syrian-schools-jamaican-bobsleds-fake-news-and-more-1.3863764/how-chicago-activists-are-using-social-media-data-to-fight-for-police-accountability-1.3863778">"How Chicago activists are using social media data to fight for police accountability" (CBC Radio)</a></p>

      <h3>Law enforcement response</h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/20/openoversight-helps-public-identify-chicago-police/">“It seems to me a little extreme.”</a>  - Dean Angelo, President of Chicago Fraternal Order of Police</p>
      <p>"Second City Cop", a popular blog for Chicago cops wrote a couple blog posts on us, including one encouraging police officers to submit false photos to us.</p>

      <img src="../assets/images/transparency/behelpful.png" width="50%" height="50%">

      <h3>Public response</h3>
      <p>We had thousands of photos uploaded (both by the public and by people doing scraping for us): so many that data validation and entry became a blocker</p>

      <img src="../assets/images/transparency/serve.png" width="80%" height="80%">

      <h2>Upcoming Release: Crowdsourcing Data Validation</h2>

      <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/lucyparsons/OpenOversight/issues/174">next release</a> adds crowdsourced data validation to OpenOversight.</p>

      <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7832803/22235803/b0aa18a2-e1cf-11e6-997b-7ab016fefbc2.png" width="80%" height="80%">

      <p>Clearly lots of automation that can be done here if the developer personpower is there</p>
